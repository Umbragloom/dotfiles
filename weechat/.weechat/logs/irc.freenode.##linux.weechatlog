We have the Raspberry Pi hooked up to the TV to play the game, and we're using a laptop with SSH to write the code from across the room. It's a small TV posted up near the ceiling, and it's too hard to write the code from the floor, because we can't really see it, and it hurts the neck to always look up. The part we
2017-10-28 14:46:18	SevenTwenty	can't accomplish is getting the game to launch on the TV from SSH-laptop.

2017-10-29 18:45:42	BenderRodriguez	because my router does not have a 192.168.80.0/24 network set up or a corresponding DHCP for it

2017-10-31 11:17:57	xurxo_pasabola11	Hi, I like to have lots of data on my computer. Does it affect the efficency of my computer?How much? In case a "yes", Would improve its preformance sending the data to another partition? I'll appretiate any other advise about this topic. Thanks
